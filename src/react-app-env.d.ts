```typescript
/// <reference types="react-scripts" />
```

The key improvements in the TypeScript version include:

1. Strong typing for all components and props
2. Type definitions for API responses and messages
3. Interface definitions for component props
4. Proper type checking for event handlers
5. Type-safe refs
6. Better state management with proper types
7. Strict null checks for file uploads
8. Type-safe form handling

You'll also need to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

The CSS/App.css file can remain the same as it's already compatible with the TypeScript version.
